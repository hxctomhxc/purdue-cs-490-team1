        New England is a Northeastern region of the United States, including the six 
        states ofConnecticut,&nbsp;Maine,Massachusetts,&nbsp;New Hampshire,Rhode Island, 
        and&nbsp;Vermont. TheAmerican Indians&nbsp;cuisine became part of the cookery style that 
        the early colonists brought with them.&nbsp;The style of New England cookery 
        originated from its colonial roots, that is to say practical, frugal and willing 
        to eat anything other than what they were used to from their British roots. Much 
        of the cuisine started with one-pot cookery, which resulted in such dishes 
        as&nbsp;succotash,&nbsp;chowder,&nbsp;baked beans, and others.

        Lobster is an integral ingredient to the cuisine, indigenous to the coastal 
        waters of the region. Other&nbsp;shellfish&nbsp;of the coastal regions include&nbsp;little neck 
        clams,sea scallops,&nbsp;blue mussels,&nbsp;oysters,&nbsp;soft shell clams&nbsp;and&nbsp;razor shell 
        clams. Much of this shellfish contributes to New England tradition, 
        the&nbsp;clambake. The clambake as known today is a colonial interpretation of an 
        American Indian tradition.

        The fruits of the region include the&nbsp;Vitis labrusca&nbsp;grapes used in&nbsp;grape 
        juicemade by companies such as&nbsp;Welch&#39;s, along with&nbsp;jelly,&nbsp;Kosher wine&nbsp;by 
        companies like&nbsp;Mogen David&nbsp;and&nbsp;Manischewitz&nbsp;along with other wineries that make 
        higher quality wines.&nbsp;Apples&nbsp;from New England include the original varieties, 
        Baldwin, Lady, Mother, Pomme Grise, Porter, Roxbury Russet, Wright, Sops of 
        Wine, Peck&#39;s Pleasant, Titus Pippin, Westfield-Seek-No-Further, and Duchess of 
        Oldenburg.&nbsp;Cranberries&nbsp;are another fruit indigenous to the region.<o:p></o:p></p>

        &nbsp;Within North America, it is also known as the&nbsp;northern lobsteror&nbsp;Maine lobster. 
        It can reach a body length of 64&nbsp;cm (25&nbsp;in), and a&nbsp;massof over 20 kilograms 
        (44&nbsp;lb), making it the heaviest&nbsp;crustacean&nbsp;in the world. Its closest relative is 
        the European lobster&nbsp;Homarus gammarus, which can be distinguished by its 
        coloration and the lack of spines on the underside of the&nbsp;rostrum. American 
        lobsters are usually bluish green to brown with red spines, but a number of 
        color variations have been observed.<o:p></o:p></p>
    <p>
        American lobsters are a popular food, with an image of refinement.&nbsp;They are 
        commonly boiled or steamed. Hardshells (lobsters that are several months past 
        their last molt) can survive out of water for up to two days if kept 
        refrigerated. Softshells (lobsters that have only recently molted) do not 
        survive more than a few hours out of water. Lobsters are usually cooked 
        alive,&nbsp;which some people consider inhumane.<o:p></o:p></p>
    <p>
        One common way of serving lobster &#39;tail&#39; (actually the&nbsp;abdomen) is with&nbsp;beef, 
        known as&nbsp;surf and turf.&nbsp;Lobsters have a greenish or brownish organ called 
        the&nbsp;tomalley&nbsp;that performs the functions of the&nbsp;liver&nbsp;andpancreas&nbsp;in a human, 
        i.e., it filters out&nbsp;toxinsfrom the body.&nbsp;Some diners consider it a delicacy, 
        but others avoid it because they consider it a&nbsp;toxin&nbsp;source or dislike eating 
        innards.<o:p></o:p></p>
    <p>
        A set of nutcrackers and a long, thin tool for pulling meat from inaccessible 
        areas are suggested as basics, although more experienced diners can eat the 
        animal with their bare hands or a simple tool (a fork, knife or rock). Eating a 
        lobster can get messy, and most restaurants offer a lobster bib.&nbsp;Meat is 
        generally contained in the larger claws and tails, and stays warm quite a while 
        after being served. There is some meat in the legs and in the arms that connect 
        the large claws to the body. There is also some small amount of meat just below 
        the carapace around the thorax and in the smaller legs.<o:p></o:p></p>
