mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">East Zone of 
        India is a hot mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. Cultural and lingual 
        diversity along with rich histories and geographic heterogeneity of the 
        encompassing states makes the cuisine of this zone unique and unsurpassable.<br />
        <br />
        Fetish of the people of West Bengal for fish, rice and sweet is legendary and 
        contributes a significant lot to the popular cuisine of not just east zone but 
        also the national cuisine of India. Part of Orissa also share the love for fish 
        and rice with the state of West Bengal due to the long coastline the duo states 
        shares on the Bay of Bengal. Fish and other sea food are in plenty in this 
        region and so are the recipes.<br />
        <br />
        People in Bihar and Jharkhand love their platter with all the colours of 
        seasonal vegetables which grow in abundance and rich variety here. Influence of 
        Buddhism is apparent here as majority of the population practice vegetarianism. 
        The state came under the influence of mighty Mughals once and naturally the 
        famous Mughal cuisine left its mark here too.</span></p>
