        <strong>The South</strong><o:p></o:p></p>
    <p class="style4">
        The&nbsp;cuisine&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Southern United States&nbsp;is defined as the historical regional 
        culinary form of states generally south of the&nbsp;Mason Dixon 
        Line&nbsp;dividing&nbsp;Pennsylvania&nbsp;from&nbsp;Maryland&nbsp;and&nbsp;Delaware&nbsp;as well as along the&nbsp;Ohio 
        River, and extending west to southern&nbsp;Missouri,&nbsp;Oklahoma&nbsp;and&nbsp;Texas.<o:p></o:p></p>
    <p class="style4">
        The most notable influences come 
        from&nbsp;Scottish,&nbsp;Irish,&nbsp;German,&nbsp;French,&nbsp;Spanish,&nbsp;Native American,&nbsp;English, 
        and&nbsp;African American&nbsp;cuisines.&nbsp;Cajun,&nbsp;Creole,&nbsp;Lowcountry, and&nbsp;Floribbean&nbsp;are exa<asp:Image

        mples of types Southern cuisine. In recent history, elements of Southern cuisine 
        have spread north, having an effect on the development of other types 
        of&nbsp;American cuisine.<o:p></o:p></p>
    <p class="style4">
        Many items such as&nbsp;squash, tomatoes,&nbsp;corn&nbsp;(and its derivatives, 
        including&nbsp;grits), as well as the practice of&nbsp;deep pit barbecuing&nbsp;were inherited 
        from the southeastern American Indian tribes such as the&nbsp;Caddo,&nbsp;Choctaw, 
        and&nbsp;Seminole. Many foods associated with sugar, flour, milk, eggs (many kinds of 
        baking or dairy products such as breads and cheeses) are more associated 
        with&nbsp;Europe.<o:p></o:p></p>
    <p class="style4">
        The South&#39;s propensity for a full breakfast (as opposed to a Continental one 
        with a simple bread item and drink) is derived from the English&nbsp;fry up, although 
        it was altered substantially. Much of&nbsp;Cajun&nbsp;or&nbsp;Creole&nbsp;cuisine is based 
        on&nbsp;France, and on&nbsp;Spain&nbsp;to a lesser extent. Floribbean is more Spanish-based 
        with obvious Caribbean influences, while&nbsp;Tex-Mex&nbsp;has 
        considerable&nbsp;Mexican&nbsp;and&nbsp;Native American&nbsp;influences.<o:p></o:p></p>
    <p class="style4">
        A traditional Southern meal is pan-fried chicken, field peas (or black eyed 
        peas), greens (such as&nbsp;collard greens&nbsp;or mustard), mashed 
        potatoes,&nbsp;cornbread&nbsp;or&nbsp;corn pone,&nbsp;sweet tea, and a dessert that is usually a pie 
        (sweet potato,&nbsp;chess,shoofly,&nbsp;pecan, and&nbsp;peach&nbsp;are traditional southern pies), 
        or a&nbsp;cobbler&nbsp;(peach, blackberry, or mixed berry are traditional cobblers).&nbsp;At 
        least a dozen soups also have their origins in the American South.<o:p></o:p></p>
    <p class="style4">
        Some other foods and beverages commonly associated with the South 
        are&nbsp;grits,&nbsp;country ham,&nbsp;hushpuppies, Southern styles of&nbsp;succotash,&nbsp;mint 
        juleps,&nbsp;chicken fried steak,&nbsp;buttermilk biscuits&nbsp;(may be served 
        with&nbsp;gravy&nbsp;or&nbsp;sorghum),&nbsp;pimento cheese, boiled or baked sweet potatoes,&nbsp;pit 
        barbecue&nbsp;(especially ribs),&nbsp;catfish&nbsp;(often fried like chicken),&nbsp;fried green 
        tomatoes,&nbsp;bread pudding, okra (steamed, stewed, sauteed, or pickled),&nbsp;butter 
        beans,&nbsp;pinto beans, and&nbsp;black eyed peas. A common snack food, in season, 
        is&nbsp;boiled peanuts.<o:p></o:p></p>
    <p class="style4">
        Fried chicken is among the region&#39;s best-known exports, though pork is also an 
        integral part of the cuisine, with&nbsp;Virginia ham&nbsp;being one renown form. A 
        traditional holiday get-together featuring whole hog barbecue is known in 
        Virginia and the Carolinas as a &quot;pig pickin&#39;&quot;. Green beans are often flavored 
        with&nbsp;bacon&nbsp;and&nbsp;salt pork, biscuits served with ham often accompany breakfast, 
        and ham with&nbsp;red-eye gravy&nbsp;or&nbsp;country gravy&nbsp;is a common dinner dish. A bit 
        of&nbsp;fatback&nbsp;is added to many vegetable dishes, especially greens, for flavoring.<o:p></o:p></p>
    <p class="style4">
        It is not uncommon for a traditional southern meal to consist of only vegetables 
        with no meat dish at all, although meat or meat products are often used in the 
        cooking process. &quot;Beans and Greens,&quot; which consists of either white or brown 
        beans alongside a &quot;mess&quot; of greens has always been popular in most parts of the 
        South. Turnip greens are generally prepared mixed with diced turnips and a piece 
        of fatback. Another Southern staple is &quot;Beans and Cornbread,&quot; consisting of 
        pinto beans, stewed with ham or bacon, and&nbsp;cornbread. This is served sometimes 
        with collard, turnip, or mustard greens. It is often said that Southerners tend 
        to cook down their vegetables a little longer and/or use more seasoning than 
        other Americans, but it often depends on the cook.<o:p></o:p></p>
    <p class="style4">
        Southern desserts include many dishes such as strawberry shortcake, banana 
        pudding, baked apple slices, sweet potato pie, apple pie, pumpkin pie, and many 
        other pies utilizing fruits that are grown around the area.<o:p></o:p></p>
